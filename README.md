# OGMP
OGMP is the **O**ver**G**rowth **M**ulti**P**layer mod, an unoffical addition to the upcoming game [Overgrowth](http://www.wolfire.com/overgrowth) by Wolfire Games.

## Installation
To install the mod you simply have to merge the *Data* folder of the mod with your Overgrowth folder (e.g., *C:\Program Files\Steam\SteamApps\common\Overgrowth*).

If you want to uninstall OGMP you can use the original files from http://forums.wolfire.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=15409 to reset all changes.

## Usage
To connect to a server you first have to load a level. Once the level is loaded you can press **F12** to open the connection window. You can either connect to a public server like [ogmp.net](http://ogmp.net/) or you can host your own server with [ogmp_server](https://github.com/ogmp/ogmp_server).

Once you are connected you can press **F11** to see who is online. You can also use **K** to save a position and **L** to teleport to that position. This is very handy for parkour levels. You can chat with other players that are on the same level as you by pressing **enter**. Before you can write you have to click in the input box.

## Bugs
This mod is still early alpha and buggy. If you encounter a bug it would be nice to send us information about it via the issue tracker of Github. Please try to avoid duplicates though.
